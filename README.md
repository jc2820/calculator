# Calculator

Creating a calculator as precourse work for FAC winter 2019.  
See the finished version here: https://jc2820.github.io/calculator/

### Possible further improvements
Commas automatically entered at appropriate thousands in the display.

Backspace button

positive/negative button (so it could run calculations like (x - -y) etc)

Key bindings for operator keys are currently set to the numpad operator buttons on a full keyboard. This is due to cross browser and OS laptop keyboard differences. It would be nice to find a nice workaround for any small keyboard.
