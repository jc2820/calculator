# Calculator

Creating a calculator as precourse work for FAC winter 2019.  
See the current version here: https://jc2820.github.io/calculator/

### Possible further improvements
* Commas automatically entered at appropriate thousands in the display.

* Backspace button

* positive/negative button (so it could run calculations like (x - -y) etc)

* Key bindings for operator keys are currently set to the numpad operator buttons on a full keyboard. This is due to cross browser and OS keyboard differences. It would be nice to find a nice workaround for any small keyboard.

* On Chrome there is a bug where pressing the return key after a numeric entry (with mouse or keyboard) either repeats the current display value or zeros it. This is possibly to do with using a form input box for the display. There may be a way to disable the return key on this document.
